## General Information
This project is a team collaboration between students of [START School of Code by SocialInnov](https://www.startproject.gr/school-of-code/).  The aim of the bootcamp is to provide young professionals with the necessary tools and skills for a Javascript Developer in today's market.

The project is a React.js application that must have a Dashboard page -- listing fast stats and a quick overview of classes available, a Courses page -- the full comprehensive list of classes available, an Add Course page -- a form that allows users to add classes to the application and a Course Details page that gives in-depth information about the class. The same page also allows the user to either edit or delete the currently selected course.

## Modules and Methods
The modules used for this project were:

 - **Axios.js/Fetch API** -- Used for API calls. Each member used their module of choice for this task 
 -   **React-router** -- A necessary building block for turning SPAs to MPAs
 - **TailwindCSS** -- This solution was picked among others as the most flexible, lightweight and the ability to create complex elements. 
 - **FontAwesome** -- FontAwesome's react module was used in parallel with our styling module in an effort to create a cohessive design


The team used professional channels of communication such as Slack, Teams etc. to organise and keep track of the project's progress. Each member was assigned with a specific task (sprint) and upon completion it was peer reviewed before moving forward with the next task. 

## The Team
The team consists of the following 4 students:
